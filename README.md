# Job Application Pipeline
1. An application that leverages the power of LLMs and Embedding models to take a given CV, cover letter and user profile (user input) and performs a scrape on popular job board websites and gives a list of well-suited job adverts.
2. The application then generates a custom tailored CV and cover letter for each job in that list of tailored ads.
3. (Beta) Using automation tools, it applies to the job using the custom-made documents.
